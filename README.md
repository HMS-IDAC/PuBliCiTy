# PuBliCiTy
Python Bioimage Computing Toolkit


## Note to Style Purists
One of the goals of this project was to approximate existing similar toolkit and functions writen in Matlab.
Therefore some function names will look familiar to Matlab users, e.g. tic, toc, imshow, imread, imwrite, ...
However camelCase style was adopted as the library, and code that depends upon it, grew.
Perhaps a complete snake_case re-write would be in order.
As a mathematician would say, this is trivial, and left as an exercise to the reader.
